the PDF file is written in Vietnamese. It include 2 parts, part I is theorical stuffs like making intuition about Neural Network, how Neural Network can approximate any dataset, introduction to 2 kinds of Neural Network. Part II is implementation


I couldn't upload my training file into github because it's too large (greater than 25MB). So I uploaded my testing file instead. You can download my repository and training file seperately.

I wrote my code so that you can examine the distribution of the dataset so that you could choose methods efficiently. If you want to do another jobs, you could change the model architecture, the dataset as you want.
